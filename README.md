# 📝 Subject
This project is, as its name suggests, a practice. It aims to make us practice networks (IPs, routing...) with 10 exercises that are mandatory.
The evaluation consists in succeeding 3 random levels between 6 and 10 in less than 15 minutes. Except the files that prove that the 10 exercises zere succeeded at least once, there's nothing to submit.
